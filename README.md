<h2>Popup Menus</h2>
<p>The popup menus can be shown by right clicking. Clicking outside the popup menu will hide the menu. The type of popup menu shown depends on where you right click - the charge popup menu&nbsp;(<em>Figure 2</em>) is shown when right clicking a charge, while the default popup menu (<em>Figure 1</em>) is shown when right clicking anywhere else.</p>
<h3>Default Popup Menu</h3>

<p>The default popup menu, once brought up by right clicking somewhere other than a charge, presents nine options: Add Charge, Reset Charges, Get Electric Field Strength; Zoom In, Zoom Out, Set Bounds, Show/Hide Grid; Set Precision; Help. Each of these options are talked about in more detail in their respective sections below.</p>
<h3>Charge Popup Menu</h3>

<p>The charge popup menu, once brought up by right clicking on a charge, presents some information about the charge and two options. The information given is the value of the charge, in C/mC/&mu;C/nC, based on what is appropriate, as well as the coordinate location of the charge on the grid in a (x, y) format, again with appropriate units, from m/mm/&mu;m/nm. The two options presented are to either delete or modify the charge.</p>
<h2>Charges/Electric Field</h2>
<p>This section will talk about how to use the charges and get information about the electric field. This section assumes you know how to open the default popup menu and charge popup menu talked about above. To get the&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Adding Charges</h3>
<p>To add charges, first bring up the default popup menu. In the popup menu, the first option is Add Charge, as shown in&nbsp;<em>Figure 1</em>. By clicking on this option, a new window titled "Add Charge" will appear (<em>Figure 3</em>). There are three fields to fill: x coordinate, y coordinate and charge. Also, there are options beside each field to choose the unit of choice. After entering values and selecting units, click "Add Charge" to add the charge. If you change you mind, you can click "Cancel" to exit back to the main window.</p>

<h3>Removing Charges</h3>
<p>To remove charges, first right click the charge to delete. In the popup menu, the third entry is "Remove Charge", as shown in&nbsp;<em>Figure 2.</em> Clicking this will remove the charge.</p>
<h3>Modify Charges</h3>
<p>To modify charges, first right click the charge to modify. In the popup menu, the fourth entry is "Modify Charge", as shown in&nbsp;<em>Figure 2.</em> Clicking this will bring up a window titled "Modify Charge" which looks almost the same as the "Add Charge" window (<em>Figure 3)</em>. Follow the same steps as for adding a charge here, and then click the "Modify Charge" button to modify the charge.&nbsp;If you change you mind, you can click "Cancel" to exit back to the main window.</p>
<h3>Resetting Charges</h3>
<p>If you wish to remove all charges, you can use the "Reset Charges" option, found as the second option in the default popup menu (<em>Figure 1</em>).</p>
<h3>Getting Charge Value</h3>
<p>There are two methods to get the value of a charge. The first way is to press on a charge (left click on the charge, but do not release). While you stay clicked, the charge information - charge value and location - will continue to be shown. When you release, the information will stop being shown. The other method is to right click on the charge. This will bring up the charge popup menu displaying the same information in the first two entries. The information will stay shown until another action is taken.</p>
<h3>Getting Electric Field Strength</h3>
<p>There are two methods of getting electric field strength. Left clicking anywhere on the screen will bring up the information about the electric field strength - the magnitude and direction - in the top left corner. If you want the charge at a specific location, you can use the other method. First bring up the default popup menu, then click the third option "Get Electric Field Strength" shown in&nbsp;<em>Figure 1</em>. This will bring up a new window titled "Coordinates for electric field strength" (<em>Figure 4</em>). Here, there are two fields to enter the x and y coordinate value, and dropdowns to select the unit of choice. Clicking "Cancel" will exit back to the main window. Clicking "Yes" will bring up a new window with the electric field strength at the location specified in the previous window (<em>Figure 5</em>).</p>

<h2>Grid Display</h2>
<p>This section deals with how to change the grid display to better suit your needs. It is assumed you already know how to bring up the default popup menu (talked about before).</p>
<h3>Zooming In</h3>
<p>There are multiple ways to zoom in. Firstly, you can click the fourth option in the default popup menu, which will zoom into the center of the screen. You can also scroll down to zoom in. If you have a touchpad instead of a mouse, moving two fingers away from each other will also allow you to zoom in. If you scroll or use your touchpad to zoom, you will zoom towards where the cursor is instead of the center of the screen. You will be prevented from zooming in past a certain point.</p>
<h3>Zooming Out</h3>
<p>Zooming out is done almost the same way as zooming in. You can click on the fifth option in the default popup menu to zoom out of the center of the screen. You can also scroll up or move fingers towards each other to zoom out from where your cursor is. You will be prevented from zooming out past a certain point.</p>
<h3>Dragging</h3>
<p>Pressing down on your mouse (clicking and not releasing) and moving your mouse will allow you to drag the screen around. The screen will be dragged the same amount and direction the cursor has moved.</p>
<h3>Setting Grid Bounds</h3>
<p>If zooming and dragging does not let you get your ideal grid bounds, you can manually enter them. To do this, click the sixth option in the default popup menu (<em>Figure 1</em>), which will bring up a window titled "Set Bounds" (<em>Figure 6</em>). Here you can enter the left, right, top and bottom boundary information, as well as select the correct units. Clicking "Set Bounds" will update the window to the new bounds, and clicking "Cancel" will bring you back to the main window.<br />

<h3>&nbsp;Showing/Hiding Grid</h3>
<p>The grid is initially shown, but if you wish to hide it, you can select the seventh option, "Hide Grid" in the default popup menu (<em>Figure 1</em>)&nbsp;<em>to</em> hide it. If you wish to show the grid again, the seventh option will have changed to "Show Grid", which you can click to bring back the grid.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3>Set Precision</h3>
<p>The eighth option in the default popup menu is "Set Precision". The values for electric field are normally shown with 3 digits after the decimal, but if you wish to have another level of precision, you can enter a positive integer here to indicate the number of digits after the decimal you would like shown.</p>
<h3>Help</h3>
<p>Right click anywhere but a charge, then select the last option "Help". Another way to access the help menu is to click the "Help" button at the top right of the screen.</p>
